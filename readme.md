# EMGauntlet

Based on project at https://hackaday.io/project/8823-super-simple-muscle-emg-sensor/details

Muscles create many action potentials during a movement, like moving your arm or closing your hands. This creates a measurable signal, which shows an increase in signal due to different fingers moving. (Hackaday)

This project extends the Hackaday project to wirelessly communicate the EMG signals to another device.
