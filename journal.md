# July 12th

Used the Hackaday schematic as a starting point. Also added an ESP32 module and some power management (battery charging and power switching is HARD). Schematic is done, just need to add footprints and then make the PCB.

Fixed all errors and passed ERC. Also added footprints to all components. 
Threw stuff into PCB, organized everything, and autorouted. Everything fits onto the top layer 65mmx42mm!
It's looking more like a gauntlet sort of than a slim band but that's ok since it's using a lot of larger components.

Caught a few mistakes here and there, and generated production files. Still need to mess around with JLCPCB assembly and see what can be done there.

Time spent: 2h

**Total time spent: 11h**
